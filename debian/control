Description: main loop integration development files for python3-dbus
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 This package provides development files required to compile main-loop
 integration modules for python3-dbus, such as dbus.mainloop.pyqt5 provided
 by PyQt. It is Python-version-independent, and was shared between Python 3
 and Python 2 when Python 2 was supported in Debian, so packages that
 build-depend on python-dbus-dev should also build-depend on python3-dbus.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (Python 3 interface)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 This package provides a Python 3 interface to D-Bus.
 .
 See the dbus description for more information about D-Bus in general.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (Python 3 interface - tests)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 .
 This package contains automated tests for the "dbus" Python bindings for
 the reference D-Bus implementation, to be run under Python 3.
 .
 See the dbus description for more information about D-Bus in general.
